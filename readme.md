# Subreddit CSS concepts

**This is currently a work in progress**.

I, like many others, find reddit's default css styles rather visually unappealing. I decided to create my own in Sass,
and you can check out its current status at [r/adCaela](reddit.com/r/adCaela).

## TODO

* Fix broken default link icons. See #1 for more details.
* Fix main header for both text only and image headers.
* Fix submit new link/text page. See #3 for more details.
* Fix subscribe button on the sidebar. See #4 for more details.
